# Commits pattern

In order to improve our workflow, we adopt a pattern to better illustrate and define each commit and emojis are a great way to do that! 😀

Here goes our reference table with each kind of commit and it's emojis:

| Code changes  | Cleaning  | Maintenance |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 💥 breaking changes | 🛠️ refactoring | 💻 tools |
| 🚀 features | 💎 linting | 📦 dependencies |
| ✨ improvements | 📖 documentation | 🚚 build files |
| 🐛 bug fixes |  | 🚨 tests |
