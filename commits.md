# Commits pattern

In order to improve our workflow, we adopt a pattern to better illustrate and define each commit and emojis are a great way to do that! 😀

Here goes our reference table with each kind of commit and it's emojis.

| 💥 Breaking changes | 🛠️ Refactoring | 💻 Tools |
| 🚀 Features | 💎 Linting | 📦 Dependencies |
